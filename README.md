## Overview

In this project, I learnt the steps of security I can apply to many projects.

- Level 1 : Split server with a client side and check if username and password are correct from database.
- Level 2 : Save encryted password to Database and save encryption key to .env file and Don't open .env to public
- Level 3 : Use Hashing functions libraries
- Level 4 : Salting and Hashing password with bcrypt library so you can strengthen your security
- Level 5 : Add cookies and sessions. so server can remember if you logined already.
- Level 6 : OAuth (This is bring google or facebook authentication functions to your project).


## How to start

You can check out my code at every step from Level 1 to 6 in git log
